The Runza is a rectangular bread enclosure containing warm internal meteorology. It’s classified locally as “comfort food,” though I experienced mild atmospheric turbulence upon ingestion.

The flavor is simple, honest, and slightly defensive — much like the Nebraskan people themselves.

I rate it 8 out of 10 on the Assimilation Index. A comforting weapon in a cold world.
