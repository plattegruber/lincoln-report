The Sunken Gardens are a crater filled with flora and unguarded joy. No entry fee, no territorial markings, no obvious purpose — just beauty for its own sake. I suspect a trap.

Humans wander through it hand-in-hand, exchanging pheromonal smiles. I performed the same ritual with a borrowed hand (left over from a Halloween display). The results were inconclusive but aesthetically pleasing.

If this is what humans do for leisure, I understand now why they’ve survived their own cooking.
