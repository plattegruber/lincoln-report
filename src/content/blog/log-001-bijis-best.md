## Field Log: Biji's Best Convenience and Refueling

**05:48:23 Zlorp Time** — I observe the refueling station from a distance with great interest. The humans guide their vehicles to the building but do not attach the hoses. Instead, they enter the building, then exit soon after with styrofoam receptacles stacked in hand. I can see them salivating from here. Moving closer.

**05:55:01 Zlorp Time** — The refueling station is busy but I've found an opening. The odor as I open the door is unlike anything I've experienced—thick with human spices, warm and inviting. Is it a trap? Too intrigued to turn back now.

**05:56:49 Zlorp Time** — I approach the counter. The human bearing their teeth appears friendly, though I'm still jarred by what they call "smiling." I swivel my eyeballs back and forth—two options!? I am confused. I pick one. The human loads up my styrofoam receptacle with homemade rice, bright pickled vegetables, and the seasoned, roasted meat of a water animal (I heard a tiny human call it *fshsh*—"fshsh?"—the tiny human ran to her guardian human).

**05:59:20 Zlorp Time** — I am also thirsty. I see other humans grabbing sodas, chips, candy bars—I will do the same to blend in. This seems to be one advantage of serving food in a gas station.

**06:04:21 Zlorp Time** — I give my human bucks to the cashier and leave.

**06:09:28 Zlorp Time** — I sit in my spaceship disguised as a 2017 Honda Accord. I wish Biji's Best had tables, but they don't, so I must consume in my vehicle.

**06:10:10 Zlorp Time** — Oh wow. Woah.

**06:28:58 Zlorp Time** — My mouth wants more but my belly cannot. I must recline. Reporting to Mothership.

> **Mothership**: Secure connection established. Reviewing field logs now. Designation Observer: Type Three Entity, we are missing logs containing information about the meal itself. We are investigating this glitch now. In the meantime—what can you report?
>
> **D.O.T.T.E.**: No glitch. The sustenance the humans prepare at this establishment caught me off guard. The humble facade did not prepare me for how delicious the meal would be. I simply forgot to record logs while I consumed the meal.
>
> **Mothership**: Message received. Are we safe to assume we can add this to our "Consider Not Destroying" list?
>
> **D.O.T.T.E.**: Confirmed. Please spare this one.
>
> **Mothership**: Confirmed. Captain Nom expresses his intent to dine there tomorrow on your recommendation.
>
> **D.O.T.T.E.**: Confusingly, the humans only open this establishment every seven days.
>
> **Mothership**: *bangs* *crashes*... *static*...................
>
> **D.O.T.T.E.**: ...
>
> **Mothership**: *static*.... *ahem* the captain is not pleased to hear that report!
>
> **D.O.T.T.E.**: I share the captain's sentiment!

## Final Report

This establishment is one of a kind. The humans here prepare the food as if they care, which is more than I can say of most other establishments I've infiltrated. The limited menu turned out not to be an issue, as both meals (I went back for seconds) were delicious. The gas station setting, while strange at first, is an advantage because of the wealth of drinks and snacks to accessorize the meal. I only wish they had tables.

**Overall**: 10/10 — one of Lincoln's best.
