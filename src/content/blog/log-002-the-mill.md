I entered a facility labeled The Mill, where humans gather to sip bean-based infusions and stare into glowing rectangles. This is apparently both a social and solitary ritual, depending on how much one despises their coworkers.

When asked for my “name for the cup,” I replied truthfully: “Designation Observer, Type-Three Entity.” The barista sighed and wrote “Dotty.” I accepted this with grace. It is important to allow the natives their small triumphs.

The beverage itself was remarkable. Hot enough to sterilize a larva, yet consumed with smiles. It tasted of carbon and ambition. I shall return.
